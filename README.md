# Pink-Purple-Blue-VSCode-Theme
This is a Pink/Purple/Blue VSCode Theme based off of the "Cyberpunk 2021" theme, except green is replaced with pink.

This is one of my favorite VSCode Themes I use, since I love this color palatte. I used to use Cyberpunk 2021 without these changes. Feel free to use my changes for personal use, by including it as part of your `settings.json` file. You need to install Cyberpunk 2021 first though.

I used this theme consistently for around half a year, at least nonstop for the entirety of the Spring 2025 semester. Even though I switch between other themes now, I still often come back to this theme, because it looks cool and is one of the least eye straining themes that I have that looks cool. However, even if I don't use it, I'll still keep it up in case anyone is interested.

I also use the VSCode Pokemon extension, and have included my Pokemon settings in the `pokemon_list.json` file, feel free to use this Pokemon file too if you're interested.
