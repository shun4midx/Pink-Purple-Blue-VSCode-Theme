# Pink-Purple-Blue-VSCode-Theme
This is a Pink/Purple/Blue VSCode Theme based off of the "Cyberpunk 2021" theme, except green is replaced with pink.

This is my previous VSCode Theme since I love this color palatte and felt like using it again, I used to use Cyberpunk 2021 without these changes. Feel free to use my changes for personal use, by including it as part of your `settings.json` file. You need to first install Cyberpunk 2021 though.

I used this theme for around half a year, at least for the entirety of the Spring 2025 semester. It's pretty nice, but now I'm using the default "vsc-cyberpunk2077-theme" theme instead. However, I'll still keep it up in case anyone is interested.

I also use the VSCode Pokemon extension, and have included my Pokemon settings in the `pokemon_list.json` file, feel free to use this Pokemon file too if you're interested.
