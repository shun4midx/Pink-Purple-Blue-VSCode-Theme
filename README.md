# Pink-Purple-Blue-VSCode-Theme
This is a Pink/Purple/Blue VSCode Theme based off of the "Cyberpunk 2021" theme, except green is replaced with pink.

This is my current VSCode Theme since I love this color palatte and felt like using it again, I used to use Cyberpunk 2021 without these changes. Feel free to use my changes for personal use, by putting it into your JSON file.
