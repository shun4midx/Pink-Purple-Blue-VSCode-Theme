# Pink-Purple-Blue-VSCode-Theme
This is a Pink/Purple/Blue VSCode Theme based off of the "Cyberpunk 2021" theme, except green is replaced with pink.

This is my previous VSCode Theme since I love this color palatte and felt like using it again, I used to use Cyberpunk 2021 without these changes. Feel free to use my changes for personal use, by including it as part of your `settings.json` file. You need to first install Cyberpunk 2021 though.

I used this theme for around half a year, at least for the entirety of the spring 2025 semester. It's pretty nice, but now I'm using the default "Cyberpunk 2077 rebuild" theme instead. However, I'll still keep it up in case anyone is interested.
